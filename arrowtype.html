  <h2>Selecting the correct arrow type makes all the differance.</h2>
  <div class="Compound">
  <h3>Compound</h3>
  <p>Most compound bows nowadays are adjustable. With just a tool, such as an
    Allen wrench, both the draw lenghth and pull weight can easily be attuned
    to your personal specification. There are a few ways to measure for draw
    length. The one I recommend is to measure from the tip of your middle finger
    to the other middle finger. Take that number and divide by 2.5. The quotient
    will be your draw length. </p>
  <p>If the string does start to fray or even break, a compound bow press is
    required to string a new one. Hunters who unfortutionally face a damaged
    string, will find it challenging to replace on the grounds.</p>

  <div class="Crossbow">
  <h3>Crossbow</h3>
  <p2>Crossbows can have a draw weight over 150 pounds. The bolts have the
    potentional of traveling at speeds of 180 fps or faster. Not many archers
    or people in general have the strength of loading 150lb string. Unlike other
    bows, the crossbow has a foot handle and a cocking rope that hooks on the
    string. An archer has only to place their foot on the handle and pull up on
    the rope until the string clicks in place. While this process greatly
    decreases the required strenghth, a fair amount of strength is still needed.</p2>

  <div class="Recurve">
  <h3>Recurve Bow</h3>
  <p3>Recurve bows were greatly used in the Dark Ages and can even be traced back
    to the earliest civilizations. These bows are the simplest to create and
    require little maintanance. If a frays or the bow itself gives way,
    construction a new one wouldn't take long. Ease of use as well as the
    plethora of new material, make the recurve a fan favorite.
    One downside of the recurve bow is the amount of time it requires to become
    proficient. Sure many newer recurve bows come ready to fit a sight, but
    that takes away the beauty of the age old art form.</p3>
